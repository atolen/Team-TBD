Mapped out structure of the physics half.
Looking into Gaussian elimination and other algorithms that could potentially help us.
-G&A

Rejected Gaussian elimination. Calculator fxn will have to be bruteforced.
Created class Question.

Question --> Kinematics --> KinCalculator
Created subclass & granddaughter-class.
All physics classes henceforth will be based upon these.
Kinks worked out. Feelin' productive. B-)

Kinematics-specific calculator being written. Has to be bruteforced :-(
Lots of gruntwork to follow.

More hardcoding KinCalc.
Issue regarding solving for t in one equation resolved.
Done with fxns in KinCalc. Must still be tested, and put together into calculate.
(But it compiles!)

KinCalculator removed, all methods moved to Kinematics. Kinematics cleaned up.
All kinematic fxns tested, all bugs fixed. No more NPEs!!! 
Calculate() to be started.

Bug fixes
Began class Character

Finished Calculate()! It's in it's simplest form, but everything works.
Began writing method to compare user input to machine-generated correct answers.

compare() written, began working on user interface-y things. Progress is being made!
-G&A

Began ASCII introduction/user interface-y things in class Game.
Uses pauses to help with game flow.

Continued work with Game.java, started building other subclasses of Question. (Wind is a-howling, but the snow outside WILL be played in!)
-G&A

Kinematics methods made static and applied to class Projectiles. User input mechanism in Game.java functioning, complete with IOExceptions.
